This palace is decorated with 953 windows or 'Jharokhas' which are adorned with intricate designs. There's a small museum within the complex of Hawa Mahal, which houses famous items like miniature paintings and ceremonial armor.The main reason behind the making of Hawa Mahal was to felicitate Rajput women who were not allowed to appear in public places.
