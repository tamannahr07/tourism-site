						One of the most remarkable natural landmarks in Meghalaya, Umngot River is a spectacle. With crystal clear water and view of the Bangladesh border, this river offers kayaking, boating and even camping on the river side. Our band The Cosmic Truth travelled from Delhi to Meghalaya, and in the 4 day self driving trail in their Maruti Suzuki Alto they decided to visit the famed river. They were spellbound by how clear the water was, as one could see the bottom of the river with schools of fishes. Adding to the magic was the soft morning light and oarsmen going about their business of ferrying people across and fishing. Our participants decided to give kayaking a try, and going by their smiles, it is safe to say that they had an outstanding experience.<br>


						<b>Famous For</b><br>
						The Umngot River acts as a natural divide between Jhantia and Khasi hills, before finally flowing into Bangladesh. They say that the water of the river is so clear that the boats floating on it look as if they are on a crystal glass surface.</font></p><br><br>
