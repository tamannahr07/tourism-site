					Tsomgo Lake; popular as Changu lake among the locals, is the revered river of the Sikkimese people that also carries special significance for the faith healers (Jhakris) of the state. This astoundingly beautiful glacial lake offers as an aspiring outing place for the tourists as well as for the locals. The adventure starts with the trek through the winding trails amidst the edgy cliffs that takes you to the serene Tsomgo lake, where other activities like riding on colourfully decorated yaks and mules awaits to make for a perfect weekend getaway.<br>


					<b>Famous For</b><br>
					Tsomgo Lake is known for its changing colour of water. During the monsoon season, this lake appears to be a bright aquamarine lake; however, in winter season, the water of the lake freezes in the translucent layer of ice. When summer comes during the mid of May, the edges of this lake gets sprinkled with numerous blossoming flowers that gives the lake a beautiful appearance in stunning colours.</font></p><br><br>
